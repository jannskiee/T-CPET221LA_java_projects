// Create a simple calculator program for a cashier in a grocery. Your program will require to input the price of three items, the payment of the customer; and also the customerâ€™s age. Use the following below as a reference for your computation.
//        a.	All items are subject to 10% tax rate.
//        b.	If the customer is a senior citizen, the have an discount of 20%
//        c.	At the end of the program, display the change of the customer. Display also if the payment of the customer is insufficient.
